# Planning-and-Learning-in-Robotics
Projects related to path planning and learning algorithms like Dynamic Programming, A*, etc

## Dynamic Programming - DoorKey problem
- Implemented Dynamic Programming to solve a doorkey problem on given environments
- Extended the previous implementation to pre-compute an optimal policy, which could be used for different environments with changing conditions like key/goal locations, etc

## Moving goal capture using A* algorithm
- Implemented a weighted A* algorithm to intercept a moving target in an environment with obstacles
